# Smart Campus Services App
Integrating smart campus services with one click away.

## Problem
NTU is known for being a **futuristic Smart Campus** with incredible technologies and facilities. President of NTU Prof Suresh has introduced the idea of **smart pass** around the university. A smart pass act as a **personal identification** from allowing user security access to libraries, labs, authorized buildings, to facilities bookings and many campus services.

> Figure 1: NTU Smart Campus Vision. We treat this as our model for developing our app.

However, the current problem is that **all the systems are sparsely distributed** - they are located in different websites and managed by different departments. This is really hard for new students or visitors to locate each type of service. 


## Solution
We created an **all-in-one app** where we can have complete smart services for university problems.

Some existing services may already be secure and robust enough, so there is no need to replace the services with our new systems. Hence, we created an app that could **link all the existing reliable systems** while also provided exciting new features for non-existing services.


# Features included

## QR Matriculation Card - 
Today’s NTU matriculation card acts as a smart pass, but often the physical card is very easy to be lost. We made a **QR code** of your matriculation card so that you can **scan** it to **take attendance, access school facilities, make payments**, and many more.

## Food Pre-Ordering - 
Ever want to skip long queues in canteens? Now you can **pre-order** your meal at any canteen across the campus and pay beforehand. An **email notification** will be sent to you when your meal is ready for collection. You can even check your **order history** to see what’s your top 5 favourite canteens across NTU! 

## Lifestyle Tracker - 
The user-friendly service will guide you to a balance lifestyle in university. The basic features of this tracker will analyze users’ **monthly expenses**, and provide users with a **heatmap** of most visited locations in university areas. The future features will even provide users with research results and user customization towards healthy lifestyle.
